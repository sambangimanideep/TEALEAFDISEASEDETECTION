As part of the Mobile Application Development course at Amrita School of Computing, we developed a real-time AI-powered app titled "TEA Leaf Disease Detection." This application focuses on identifying TEA leaf diseases through image analysis, designed to support agricultural stakeholders by enabling quick, accurate disease detection and promoting crop health. It explores the integration of image recognition technologies to enhance user interaction and accessibility within the agriculture domain.
Our project utilizes the kaggale tea leafs dataset to train several models, which includes CNN (89.8%), DenseNet 201 (96.5%), EfficientNet (75.43%). Testing revealed that Densenet model provided the highest accuracy (96.5%), followed closely by CNN model at (89.8%),
efficient net at (75.43)%
